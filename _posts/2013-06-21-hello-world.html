<h2>Hello, World!</h2>

<p>Hello, World! This will be my new space to blog and really the first space I've ever actually blogged. I'm looking forward to sharing my thoughts and contributing back to the tech coummunity that has
given me so much. It can sometimes be a long and ardous road to "make it" in the tech scene in the Bay Area and I want to use this as my platform to share my experiences.</p>

<p>In the future, I'll be posting about technology related topics especially in regard to front-end development. It's a very exciting time to be working on front end problems and I want to share
my knowledge of it with everyone.</p>
