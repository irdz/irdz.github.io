		<h3>Development</h3>
		<div class="resource">
			<p><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a></p>
			<p>Sublime is my preferred text editor. It's highly customizable and best of all, extremely fast.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="resource">
			<p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a></p>
			<p>I use git and Github every day. It's a valuable tool to keep track of what I'm working on and store and distribute everything I've built. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="resource">
			<p><a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a></p>
			<p>I'm a recent convert to CodeKit, it's a great tool that auto-updates the CSS you're working with and reloads the browser.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="resource">
			<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a></p>
			<p>Xcode is by far the most beautiful IDE I've ever used. It's developed by Apple and it makes creating iOS apps a joy.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="resource">
			<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a></p>
			<p>Eclipse is a bit of a beast but it's definitely my go to tool whenever I'm working with Java and its error checking tools are next to none.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="single-column grid-30">
		<h3>Design</h3>
		<div class="resource">
			<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/mena_en/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop CS6</a></p>
			<p>I use Photoshop almost every day to edit images and design new interfaces. It has come a long way since when I first started working with it in version CS3.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="resource">
			<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Illustrator CS6</a></p>
			<p>I use Illustrator for the vast majority of my icon work. It definitely has a big learning curve but definitely worth learning.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="resource">
			<p><a href="http://xscopeapp.com/">xScope</a></p>
			<p>xScope is a great tool that helps you design interfaces. I use it all the time for measuring pixel widths.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="resource">
			<p><a href="http://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a></p>
			<p>Balsamiq is my go to tool for mockups. It's the first app I use in my design process when I want to layout a site or mobile app.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Utilities</h3>
		<div class="resource">
			<p><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a></p>

		</div>

		<div class="resource">
			<p><a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a></p>

		</div>

		<div class="resource">
			<p><a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a></p>
			<p>I use Evernote to store all of my project ideas and sometimes code snippets. It's a great tool to store everything and sync it across multiple devices.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="resource">
			<p><a href="http://www.iawriter.com/mac/">iA Writer</a></p>
			<p>iA Writer is the best writing software I've used. Its focus mode is very valuable for whenever I want to just focus on writing content for any my work.</p>
