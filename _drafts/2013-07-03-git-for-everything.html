<h2>Git for Everything</h2>

<p>I've been using git almost every day for the past three months or so, and over the course of that time I've discovered that git has many applications besides programming. A lot has been written about this subject recently, but I wanted to share my thoughts on it as a developer.</p>

<p>The real power of git for an invidual developer is greatly expanded when using Github. The best feature in my opinion of the Github platform is the contribution graph. </p>
